# Contributing

Thank you for helping improve Home Assistant Facilioo.

1. Install [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) and run `mise run setup` from a Linux or WSL checkout.
2. Make focused changes with type annotations and asynchronous I/O.
3. Run `mise run check` before committing. Use `mise run fix` to apply Ruff fixes and formatting.
4. Add tests for API/schema behavior and consumption/statistics semantics.

`mise run setup` provisions the repository-pinned Python, uv, and prek versions, synchronizes the
locked development environment, and installs the Git hook. Home Assistant's test harness targets
Linux; native Windows cannot import its Unix-only runtime modules.

Tests must fully mock HTTP. Never use a productive resident account in automated tests. Do not
post credentials, tokens, personal names, addresses, real meter IDs, or unredacted API responses
in commits, fixtures, issues, or pull requests.

The Facilioo API is external and may differ by account. When reporting a schema variation, provide
the smallest anonymized example that preserves field names and types.
